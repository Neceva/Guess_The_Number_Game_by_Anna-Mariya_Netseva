# Guess_The_Number_Game_by_Anna-Mariya_Netseva
This is a simple console game "Gues the number".

 "Guess A Number" is a game in which your opponent, "the computer",
 chooses a random number between "1 and 100", 
and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, 
the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.
